Hi!
I'm Lucas, a 24 years old Full Stack JS Developer from Argentina.
I'm currently working on a project for TECHO, an NGO that helps people along all latinamerica.
Apart from that, I'm currently learning Typescript and Python, because, well, I enjoy learning new things/technologies.

And if you're curious, I have to say that my portfolio is in progress.

Ask me about my experience if you like!
